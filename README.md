# Todos 2.0
Todos 2.0 is a Web application based on MERN stack that allows the creation of customized todo lists.

The backbone of the project is baed on an idea of Colt Steele, from "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" course, available on Udemy.
The main new features and improvements I added are the following:
- migration to MongoDB database
- new theme
- new Homepage with responsive Appbar
- authentication with local username/password and Google Id
- authorization
- ALL TODOs list available for each user
- added Priority and expring date to todos and editing functionalities
- todos sorting and filtering capabilities
- list deleting

## New Theme and Homepage

Each user has an ALL TODOs list on the top of the available item lists, which allows to view the whole set of todos for the specific user.

An user can create his own list, with the possibility to assign a name and an icon:

Furthermore, each todo item has a Priority and an Expiring Date assigned during the creation of the item:

## Sorting and Filtering

Each list can be sorted either by Priority and Expiring Date (default) or by Expiring Date only:

It is also possible to filter the todo items in each list to show only the current day items:
